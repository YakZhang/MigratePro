# MigratePro

MigratePro is an approach to enhancing GUI test case migration via synthesizing new test cases on the basis of migrated test cases, aiming at producing functional test cases with less human intervention.


## Overview
Stage-1 contains the source code for the first stage.

Stage-2 contains the source code for the second stage.

Other contains the detailed results in the paper due to space limit.



## Implementation

We implement MigratePro in Python that supports Android apps. The experiments are based on Pixel 3 Emulators running Android 6.0. 

## Acknowledgement

The code of exploration in Stage-2 is partly inspired by Droidbot.
